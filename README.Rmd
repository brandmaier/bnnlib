# Banana Neural Networks Library (bnnlib)

![](img/Abstract-Banana.png){width=200px}

`bnnlib` is a library for neural networks covering (deep) recurrent networks with long-short-term-memory (LSTM) cells. The library is written in C++ and offers R-bindings via a SWIG interface. 

The library is not optimized for speed but for flexibility in developing new architectures. Unlike modern implementation, it does not rely on optimized matrix algebra but simple activation propagation across sets of nodes, which in turn are organized into ensembles. An ensemble represents any collection of nodes, that is, either a complex node type (like a LSTM cell) or a layer of cells.

The original code was written in 2008 and lied dormant for more than 10 years. It is now slowly revived as the 'banana neural network library'. The logo is from an anonymous contributor on publicdomainvectors.org (https://publicdomainvectors.org/en/free-clipart/Vector-clip-art-of-square-peeled-banana/31874.html). The logo was released under a public domain license in 2015.

# Installation

`bnnlib' is written in C++ and needs to be compiled first. The compilation requires a C++ compiler and the SWIG library to compile the wrappers for R. A Unix-style Makefile is provided to generate the wrappers and compile a shared library. In the terminal, run

```{}
make all
```

You should find a shared object that can be loaded from R (e.g., `bnnlib.so` on Linux or macOS, or `bnnlib.dll` on Windows). Also, you should find a library containing the R function definitions to wrap the C++ calls, which is called `bnnlib.R`.

To make use of the full functionality of the library, the system should also provide commands `gnuplot` and `dot` (from Graphviz).

# Getting Started

```{r}
dyn.load(paste("bnnlib", .Platform$dynlib.ext, sep=""))
source("bnnlib.R")
cacheMetaData(1)
```

# Usage

## Create a Neural network

`bnnlib` has some factory functions to easily create standard architectures of neural networks. This is a single hidden layer network with LSTM cells (Schmidhuber & Hochreiter, 1997). The function takes three arguments, the number of inputs nodes, the number of LSTM cells, and the number of output nodes. The following network has a single input node, two LSTM cells, and one output node:

```{r}
net <- LSTMNetwork(1,2,1)
```

## Creating Training Data

```{r}

seq <- SequenceSet()
delay <- 10

num.seq <- 5

for (i in 1:num.seq) {
len <- 50
# create a sequence from scratch
input <- rep(0,len)
output <- rep(0,len)

pos <- sample(1:40,1)
cat(i,".: Position=",pos,"\n")
input[pos]<-1
output[pos+delay]<-1

seq1<-Sequence(input,output,len)

SequenceSet_add_sequence(seq,seq1)

}
```

## Creating a Trainer

There are different training algorithms available that mostly are different flavors of back-propagation.

```{r}
bp <- ImprovedRPropTrainer(net)
```

## Start the Training

```{r}
iterations <- 40
steps.per.iteration <- 500
err <- rep(NA, iterations)
for (i in 1:iterations) {
  Trainer_train__SWIG_0(bp, seq, steps.per.iteration)
  err[i] <- Network_evaluate_training_error__SWIG_0(net, seq)
}
```

With ggplot2, we can plot the training set error over iterations:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=data.frame(step=1:iterations,err),aes(x=step,y=err))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  theme_minimal()
```

## Export Network

`bnnlib` supports export of network diagrams. THis requires external libraries to render Graphviz files, e.g., the DOT package in R.

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DOT)
Network_export_to_dot_graph(net,"testfile.ps")
lines <- paste0(readLines("testfile.dot"),sep="",collapse="")
DOT::dot(lines,file="img/testfile.svg")
```

## Plotting the activations

`bnnlib` can create plots of the node activations over time using `gnuplot`. The following plot shows the LSTM CEC nodes' activations over time for a selected sequence:

```{r}
node_vec <- Network_get_nodes_with_name(net,"CEC")
GnuplotGenerator_plot_activations(net, seq1, node_vec)
```
